                    When I first dipped my toes into web development, I thought it would just be typing random code until something worked, but wow… it’s actually like building a little universe from scratch. The first time I saw a plain white page turn into something I designed with colors, boxes, and words exactly where I wanted them it felt like unlocking a cheat code for the internet. Suddenly, every button I clicked and every little line of code felt like I was whispering secret instructions to my own tiny digital world. Honestly, it’s kind of addicting like painting, but instead of brushes you have curly brackets and semicolons.

                    Mitski is one of my favourite artists. She is an indie artist who mainly does songs about love and sadness.Sometimes I think Mitski isn’t even a regular person, her music just has a different feel compared to other artists.Her songs are like little portals into a world where crying on the bus is poetic and staring at the ceiling feels like a music video.

Her songs are sad but comforting at the same time, she is very talented, I dont even know how to describe it. Her songs fit every mood and she is unapologetically herself throughout all of them. She's kinda like a wise older sister,She’s proof that you don’t have to be loud to be powerful
